How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can compare and identify what was correct before and now is wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You have the possibility to return to any point where you made an important
	change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You do no need to wait, you control it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Allows you to work in multiple codes at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat and git diff doc1 doc2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can go back before the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For everything.
